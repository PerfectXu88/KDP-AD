  title: "A Knowledge-Driven Diffusion Policy for End-to-End Autonomous Driving Based on Expert Routing"
  authors:
    - name: "Chengkai Xu"
      affiliation: "Tongji University"
  year: 2025
  venue: "arXiv preprint"
  abstract: "End-to-end autonomous driving remains constrained by the need to generate multimodal actions, maintain temporal stability, and generalize across diverse scenarios. Existing methods often collapse multimodality, struggle with long-horizon consistency, or lack modular adaptability. This paper presents KDP, a knowledge-driven diffusion policy that integrates generative diffusion modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts routing mechanism. 
The diffusion component generates temporally coherent and multimodal action sequences, while the expert routing mechanism activates specialized and reusable experts according to context, enabling modular knowledge composition.
Extensive experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. 
Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone, and activation analyses reveal structured specialization and cross-scenario reuse of experts. These results establish diffusion with expert routing as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving."
